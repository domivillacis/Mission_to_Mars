# Mission to Mars

This analysis is about gathering information about the climate of Mars, the minimum and maximum temperature and the pressure that exists on this planet.



This information is not available in any file or APIs but it can be found on public websites.

Therefore, in this project we are going to use the web scraping method, which will help us identify HTML elements on a page and extract information with Splinter and Beautiful Soup.

Finally, we are going to collect data, organise and store it as a data frame, and after analysing the data, visualise it.
